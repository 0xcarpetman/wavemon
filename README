wavemon README
--------------

wavemon is a wireless device monitoring application that allows you to watch
signal and noise levels, packet statistics, device configuration and network
parameters of your wireless network hardware. It *should* work (though with
varying features) with all devices supported by the Linux wireless kernel
extensions by Jean Tourrilhes.

While most of the planned features are more or less implemented, plase keep 
in mind that this is an beta release, and as such, it is likely not to work 
as you may expect sometimes.

The access point list is still broken on most cards; please don't report this
as a bug. I'm planning to incorporate the much-enhanced scanning feature of
recent wireless extension versions in the near future.

See the man page for an in-depth description of program operation and
configuration.

wavemon is free software; it is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License. Please refer to the file COPYING within the archive for 
details. Last but by no means least, wavemon is a fun project and the result
of the urge to play a little around with my new wavelan card, so while I
definitely hope that some people may find it useful, you should not expect too
much of this. Also, although it shouldn't do any damage to you system when
using it, you'll understand that I won't take any responsibility for this. In
other words: YOU USE THIS ON YOUR OWN RISK.

Please send any bug reports or suggestions to <gerrit@erg.abdn.ac.uk>

You can always find the latest version of this software at the wavemon page:
