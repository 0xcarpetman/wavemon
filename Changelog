0.4.0b (12/21/2002):

	- I want to take the opportunity to apologize for the lack of
	updates. It has been more than a year since the last revision,
	and I guess a lot of you have already perceived wavemon as being
	dead. This is not the case, and I sincerely hope that I'll be able
	to pick up the pace in the near future. Special thanks and big
	apologies go out to people who sent me patches, only to find the
	project seemingly abandoned. Here you go. Sorry for my laziness.

	- access point list works correctly now if your card supports the
	SIOCGIWAPLIST ioctl (which is propably not the case - the scanning
	feature of recent wireless extension versions will be supported
	in the near future) (Jan, Dave Wagner <dave@sauron.lipscomb.edu>)

	- project now uses autoconf for building (Jan)

	- Makefile modifications for ipkg package building (for mobile
	devices) (Dave W Capella <dave.capella@cornell.edu>)

	- changed "histogram slot size" in configuration screen to less
	confusing (I hope) "histogram update cycles" (Jan)

	- modifications for wireless extensions v15 compatability (now
	in kernel tree 2.5, later to be incorporated into 2.4) (Jan,
	Bruno Randolf <br1@subnet.at>)

	- configuration dump implemented (try wavemon -d) (Jan)

	- display bug on info screen (power management) fixed (Jan)

	- fixed nasty SEGV bug upon encountering unknown configuration
	specifiers (Jan)

	- problems with using multiple interfaces fixed (Sven Koch)

	- fixed parameter mismatch (va_arg / va_arg *) (Bjoern Kriews)

	- now compiles on SuSE/Alpha AXP (Kernel 2.4.4) (Bjoern)

	- some include changes (Bjoern)

0.3.3 (08/19/2001):

	- wavemon no longer segfaults when there are no wireless extensions
	installed or no interfaces can be found (Jan)

	- no more compiler errors concerning va_arg types with gcc3 (Jan)
	
	- now works with Lucent Wavelan (pre-Orinoco) interfaces (Sven
	Koch <haegar@cut.de>)

	- ncurses window confusion in info_scr.c fixed (Sven Koch 
	<haegar@cut.de>)
	
	- MAC and IP address elements are truncated to bytes before being 
	displayed (Jean Tourrilhes <jt@hpl.hp.com>)

0.3.2a (01/07/2001)

	- the access point list now uses the SIOCGIWSPY call; this is merely a
	workaround, since SIOCGIWLIST seems to be broken ATM. However, this
	means you have to execute iwspy from the wireless tools before APs
	will show up.

	- man pages
	
	- "about" screen

	- small bug fixes
	
0.3 (05/01/2001)
	
	- level histogram implemented
	
	- statistics are now obtained and averaged into a history cache
	in the background using an interval timer
	
	- dynamic device information is now correctly updated at the info 
	screen
	
	- primitive access point list (just the MACs)

	- somewhat fancier random signal generator (look mom, noise!)

	- displays maximum signal quality

	- code cleanups

0.2a (04/23/2001):

	- implemented an UI based on different monitor screens along with
	dummy screens for histogram, access points, preferences and help
	
	- network information (such as IP and MAC addresses) is now obtained
	and displayed (Ethernet and IPv4 only)
	
	- network statistics (total TX/RX packets and bytes) are now obtained
	along with the wireless statistics about discarded packets
	
	- several command line arguments added, along with -h
	
	- about page
	
	- added a random level generator for testing purposes
	
	- general cleanup of the wireless API link

0.1a (04/21/2001)

	Initial version
