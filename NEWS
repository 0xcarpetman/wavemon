0.6 (2009-04-01)
--------------------
 * Update to the latest wireless extension API (number 22),
   As a consequence of updating the wireless extensions, more
   information is now displayed, including
   - excessive TX MAC reassembly retries,
   - missed beacon count
   - display of wireless extension version used by the driver
   - the driver's internal WE version

 * wavemon now uses ioctl to obtain IW statistics and falls back
   to /proc/net/wireless only as a last resort. (It is planned
   to add netlink support in a later release.)

 * Linear scales (-l option) no longer supported, since levels
   are always reported both in log (dBm) and lin (mW).
   (NB: in case of using an old version of ~/.wavemonrc, it is
        necessary to remove the line containing 'linear_scale',
	which is the option that has been removed.)

 * Added sanity checks to the display of level information:
   - noise level is only displayed if valid signal levels exist;
   - some cards set a magic number to mean an invalid noise level - a
     constant has been added to catch such cases;
   - if the noise level (and hence the SNR value) is undefined, spread
     out the  display of quality/signal levels over the info window.

 * Added gui option for smoothing level meters (better readability).

 * Much better and more accurate information in the Access Point List.

 * Bug Fixes:
   - it is finally possible to use the Access Point List as start screen,
   - updated and fixed display of operation modes,
   - selecting the wireless interface now works with multiple interfaces,
   - header inclusion bug fix for Puppy Linux (thanks to Tom Gordon).

 * Updated all components of the autoconf build system:
   - DESTDIR is now supported for building packages
     (thanks to Christoph J. Thompson),
   - now using autoconf to set package version and build date.

 * Reorganised source tree organisation:
   - merged many small (one-line) header files into one,
   - created a 'contrib' directory for contributed scripts,
   - added 'config' directory for autoconf auxiliary scripts
   - reinstated standard GNU autoconf listing of files
