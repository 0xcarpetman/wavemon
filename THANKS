Many people contribute to wavemon by reporting problems, suggesting various
improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is a list of these people. Help
me (gerrit@erg.abdn.ac.uk) keep it complete and exempt of errors.

Christoph J. Thompson (cjsthompson@gmail.com) provided DESTDIR support for
the installation process and contributed a Slackware build script, found in
the contrib folder (2009-03-03).

Tom Gordon to help fix a build error occurring under Puppy Linux, in wavemon
version 0.5 (2009-02-06).

Dave W. Capella (dave.capella@cornell.edu) provided modifications to build
ipkg packages for mobile devices in 2002 (now in contrib).

Nelson A. de Oliveira provided helpful tips for choosing a sensible screen-size
default, and helped much to reduce annoyances in keeping the configuration-file
parser backward-compatible (0.6.7).
